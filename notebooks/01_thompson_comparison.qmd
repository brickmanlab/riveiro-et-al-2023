# Re-CHIP
44389 consensus peaks were called in both 2h_FLAG_chip1_nanog_chip2 replicates, using macs2 with narrow peak option and q-value cut off of 0.01
After subtracting any consensus peaks called in both 0h_FLAG_chip1_nanog_chip2 replicates, 44313 consensus peaks remained


## Overlap with Alba's Sox2-Gata6 cobound peaks in DP KOSR cells
Venn diagrams were produced using the [intervene](https://intervene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) package.
See helper script `01_intervene.sh` in the scripts folder.

## Re-chip peak enrichment at Alba's pluri, common, and PrE enhancers
This heatmap was produced using deeptools. See helper scripts `01_deeptools_matrix_rechip_alba_enhancers.sh` and `01_deeptools_plot_rechip_alba_enhancers.sh` in scripts folder.

## Motif analysis rechip
Homer results under riveiro_et_al_2023/results/01_thompson_rechip/motif_analysis/. See helper script `01_homer_rechip_alba_enhancers.sh`
